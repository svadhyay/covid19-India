#### ICMR
- ICMR stats contains information of tested samples and individuals and the total positive cases.
- ICMR website not showing any stats from 2020-03-28 onwards. In this case, some of the data is obtained from information shared in MOHFW press conferences/releases and other official sources.

- 2020-04-26 onwards - only "number of tested samples" count is being released
- 2020-04-29 onwards - ICMR wesbite format updated. Home page now directly displays all COVID19 related info.

#### MOHFW
- For the 2020-03-22 evening data, MOHFW summary numbers did not contain the time at which the data was frozen. In this case time from the "Statewise Status" was used for the summary data as well.
- 2020-03-23 summary data on wesbite says *"Total number of confirmed cases so far in the country as on 23 March 2020 at 10.30 AM including foreign nationals = 415 (State and District wise details awaited)"*
- 2020-03-25 morning data had total death count reduced from 10 to 9, citing *"#2nd Death Reported in Delhi is Covid-19 Negative"*
- 2020-03-26 10:15 am data has a note is statewise confirmed cases (602#) as *"# Few of the new cases have been reassigned States as per latest information"*
- 2020-03-28 morning - state wise table on MOHFW website was not present.
- 2020-03-29 evening onwards, statewise table has combined "Indian national & Foreigner confirmed cases" together, thus removing the dedicated column for confirmed cases of foreigners.
- 2020-03-30 9:30 pm data - total of confirmed cases= 1205 does not match MOHFW mentioned 1251 cases. MOHFW mentions a note saying - *"Remaining 46 cases are being assigned to states to initiate contact tracing"*
- 2020-04-03 9:00 am data - total of confirmed cases (statewise) does not match MOHFW mentioned total cases. MOHFW mentions a note saying - *"Remaining 18 cases are being assigned to states for contact tracing"*
- Sometimes statewise data carried a disclaimer for the total confirmed cases as *"States wise distribution is subject to further verification and reconciliation"*
- 2020-04-15 "*Nagaland patient shifted to Assam*"
- 2020-04-22 "*One case of Jharkhand reassigned to Bihar after reconciliation*"
- 2020-04-25 "*49 cases are being assigned to states for contact tracing*" - Reason given for mismatch between "total of confirmed cases in India" vs the manually calculated total of the same table.
- 2020-04-26 "*312 cases are being assigned to states for contact tracing*" - Reason given for mismatch between "total of confirmed cases in India" vs the manually calculated total of the same table.
- 2020-04-29 "*78 cases are being assigned to states for contact tracing*".
- 2020-04-29 "*1 Repeat case from Betul(Madhya Pradesh) Removed*". This reduces the death count in MP by 1.
- 2020-05-05 "*From 06.05.2020, the case status will be updated on the website only once a day in the morning instead of twice a day, as being done presently. All concerned may please note.*"
